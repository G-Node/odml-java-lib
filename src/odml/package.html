<h3>odML</h3> 
<p>- the open metadata markup language is meant to transport all kinds of metadata.
Metadata are contained in properties (extended key value pairs) that are grouped in 
sections. odML is XML based and by circumventing the classical name-space approach 
is offers lots of flexibility in a simple format.<br>

This package contains class definitions for properties and sections as well as a reader and 
writer for odML metadata<br>
